README :

This module changes the way certain process can do set*uid() and set*gid()
calls. The restriction is enforced on a process, and all childs. A root process
must enable the restriction, and it can't be turned off once enabled.

Semantics :

uid_min	: lower allowed uid
uid_max : upper allowed uid
gid_min	: lower allowed gid
gid_max : upper allowed gid

Root must set uid_min and gid_min before the module can be enabled. See the
enable_rsuid script for an example.

A process can enable the restrictions by writing 'rsuid enable' into /proc/<pid>/attr/exec. When that happens, a process looses *all* of it's capabilities,
even before it switches uid / gid.
